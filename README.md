# ece5831-2024-final-project

"final_project.ipynb"
This file is the main project, we showed all out work, from data pre-processing, data augmentation, hyperparameters tuning to training the model, defining the prediction function and model evaluation. 

"Graph_predictions.ipynb"
This file is just the visualization of actual angle vs predicted angle using the created model via Graphs

"visualization.ipynb"
This file shows how the model would work in real-life situations, just for demonstration

We had to make three different files because of the computational limitations, main project is under final_project.ipynb
